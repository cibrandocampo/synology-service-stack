# UniFi Controller + MongoDB for Synology

This project provides a ready-to-deploy UniFi Controller stack with MongoDB, designed to run on Synology NAS via Container Manager using Docker Compose.

## Overview

- Run your own UniFi Controller to manage UniFi network devices.
- Includes MongoDB as required by the UniFi backend.
- Uses bind-mounted volumes for persistence and compatibility with Synology's file system.
- Exposes required TCP/UDP ports for device communication and discovery.

## Configuration

All environment variables are defined in the `.env` file:

```env
# Project
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=network-infra

# Docker image versions
MONGO_VERSION=4.4
UNIFI_VERSION=v9.0

# UniFi ports
UNIFI_HTTP_PORT=9001
UNIFI_HTTPS_PORT=9002
TZ=Europe/Madrid

# Volume paths
UNIFI_DB_DATA_VOLUME_PATH=/volume1/docker/network/infra/volumes/unifi-db-data
UNIFI_DB_CONFIG_VOLUME_PATH=/volume1/docker/network/infra/volumes/unifi-db-config
UNIFI_VOLUME_PATH=/volume1/docker/network/infra/volumes/unifi-data
````

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: MongoDB 5.0+ requires a CPU with AVX support. Use version 4.4 if your Synology does not support AVX.

## How to Deploy (Synology Container Manager)

1. Open **Container Manager** in DSM.
2. Go to the **Projects** tab.
3. Click **Create**.
4. Select the path containing your `docker-compose.yml` and `.env` files.
5. Click **Create** to launch the project.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Ensure that all volume paths exist before launching the stack, or Synology may fail to bind them.

## Access

* Web interface (HTTP): [http://your-nas-ip:9001](http://your-nas-ip:9001)
* Web interface (HTTPS): [https://your-nas-ip:9002](https://your-nas-ip:9002)

## Notes

* Make sure ports 8080, 10001/UDP, 3478/UDP, etc. are not in use by other services.
* For optimal compatibility with UniFi devices, leave the exposed ports as defined unless you know what you're doing.
* The volumes ensure persistence of MongoDB data and UniFi configuration between reboots or updates.
